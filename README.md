## Introduction

The Holberton Simple Shell Project is an educational endeavor to learn about operating systems and the fundamentals of shell programming. This shell implementation allows users to interact with the underlying operating system through text-based commands.

## Features

- Basic shell commands execution.
- Command execution with arguments and options.
- Error handling and reporting.
- Custom prompt for user input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```c
   https:https://github.com/khalilBahi/holbertonschool-simple_shell

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```c
   cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
3. Compile the shell program:
  
   ```c
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
  
4. Run the shell:
   ```c
   ./hsh
   ```
You'll be greeted by the custom shell prompt. Enter commands and press Enter to execute them.

## Code Snippets

Here are a few snippets that demonstrate how some of the supported commands are implemented in our Simple Shell:
